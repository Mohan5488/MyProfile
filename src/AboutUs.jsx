                    <p>
                    I am a Computer Science student with strong expertise in full-stack web development, particularly using Python frameworks like Django. I excel in designing clean, responsive websites with a focus on user experience, leveraging my skills in front-end technologies and backend integration. I have experience building complex applications like a Digital Health Record Management System and am passionate about creating solutions that address real-world problems, especially in healthcare. My ability to integrate security features like fingerprint authentication and work with databases like PostgreSQL makes me a versatile developer.
